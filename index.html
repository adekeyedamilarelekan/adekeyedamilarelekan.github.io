				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<span class="image main"><img src="deewan.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>
					I am a Versatile Embedded Systems & Single-Board Computer Engineer, AI and Machine Learning
					Developer with a strong
					passion
					for advancing research and innovation. I am proficient in Python, SQL, C/C++, Java and various data
					engineering techniques. Skilled in designing and implementing complex algorithms for embedded
					systems, with a focus on
					leveraging AI and Deep Learning methodologies to tackle real world challenges.
				</p>
				<p> My higher educational journey began with the completion of the National Diploma Programme and I
					obtained a honor and certification in
					<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DJjeseXRjwVcRf2xT_8o9mPgFRkJhsD0/view?usp=sharing"
						target="_blank" class="deewan-custom-link">National Diploma in Electrical and
						Electronic Engineering Technology</a>
					at
					<a href="https://www.kwarastatepolytechnic.edu.ng/" target="_blank" class="deewan-custom-link">
						Kwara State Polytechnic Ilorin</a>,
					a renowned institution known for its commitment to excellence in technical education.
					During this transformative period, I acquired a solid foundation in Electrical and Electronic
					Engineering principles and developed a passion for innovation and problem-solving. <br><br>
					However, before I was admitted into the polytechnic which was right after I completed my secondary
					education, I
					started an apprenticeship in a privately owned organization called <strong>Muyisonic Mobile
						Link</strong>,
					popularly known and accredited for its expertise in <strong><i>Mobile Phone Software and Hardware
							Troubleshooting and Repair</i></strong> while I spent three (3) years to learn and came out
					the best and
					outstanding apprentice and most of the works was done by me. <br><br>
					Maintaining this strong foundation before and after I graduated from the Polytechnic, with the
					talents and skills I
					have had, my
					journey began and continued respectively in the realm of Embedded Systems Engineering, where I honed
					my skills in designing
					and implementing robust, efficient systems that seamlessly integrate with the physical
					world.<br><br>
					Building upon this strong foundation, I furthered my academic pursuits and I proudly hold a <a

				<p>
					Over
					the years, I've had the privilege of working on a myriad of projects, from bare-metal firmware
					development to complex IoT solutions, each imbued with its own set of challenges and opportunities
					for innovation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Driven by an insatiable thirst for knowledge, I ventured into the captivating realm of
					<strong>Airtficial Intelligence and Machine Learning</strong>
					, captivated by the prospect of imbuing machines with
					the power to
					learn, reason, and adapt autonomously. <br> As an AI and Machine Learning Developer, I've had the
					privilege of exploring the depths of neural networks, delving into the nuances of algorithms, and
					leveraging the power of data to unlock insights that drive meaningful impact.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition to my passion for AI and Embedded Systems, I possess a strong foundation in Data
					Engineering, adept at architecting scalable data pipelines, designing efficient databases, and
					extracting actionable insights from vast troves of information. Proficient in Python and SQL
					development, I wield these tools with precision and finesse, transforming ideas into reality and
					orchestrating harmonious symphonies of code.
